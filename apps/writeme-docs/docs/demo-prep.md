## Demo Scenario

Today we're excited to delve deeper into some of the features that make WriteMe the perfect platform for aspiring writers and enthusiastic readers. Khyal is new to WriteMe and because this is his first time using WriteMe he will be aided by an onboarding system to make getting started with his first story as easy and as smooth as possible. The onboarding system will take him through a step-by-step procedure on how to firstly create a story and secondly create a new chapter for his story. This step-by-step guide includes helpful information as well as pointers on what to click next to help khyal get started.

As you can see WriteMe breaks a story into its seperate chapters. This gives Khyal complete control of writing, creating and removing specific chapters without having to search through his entire book to find a chapter. Khyal may also leave comments on each chapter as helpful notes to himself or for the community of WriteMe users to view later on once the story is published. Using our editor, Kyhal also has the option to edit individual chapters before publishing them.

One of WriteMe's most important features is its social interaction. From the explore page Kyhal can see a wide variety of stories published by other WritMe users. Kyhal likes the sound of the I Passed 332 story so he would like to take a further look at it.Khyal sees the comments on the story are all very positive so he decides that he would like to read some of it for himself. From here Khyal can choose a specific chapter to read.
