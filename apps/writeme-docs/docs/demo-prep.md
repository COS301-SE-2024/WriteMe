## Demo Scenario

### The Problem We Were Given:

### Run Through:

WriteMe is a safe and secure application that has multiple different log in and sign up methods to make life as easy as possible for the user. Khyal can use his Github account to sign up with just a few clicks. Once signed up he has a wide variety of published stories he can view but he first wants to create his own story before reading other ones. Creating a story is as simple as selecting the create story button and entering a title for your story. There are other fields that he may enter at this time but these are optional. He must however enter a title as this field is required and he will not be able to continue without doing this. Once creating his story he will be able to use our editor to write his story. Our editor has many helpful commands to help him with the styling so he can fully focus on the creative side of the story. Khyal can also choose from a variety of suggestions on the right hand side if he gets stuck or needs some inspiration. Once Kiyal is finished with his story he can publish his story for all other WriteMe users to see and enjoy. Once published Khyals story is added to the list of stories we saw earlier. Now that Khyal has published his own story he would like to read one of the other stories. Once he has read through this story he would also like to see the rest of the communities work so he heads over to the explore page to see what other people have been working on
