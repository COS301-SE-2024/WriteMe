## Demo Scenario

### The Problem We Were Given:

**Matt** People who enjoy reading and writing stories often have a difficult time finding a place to read ,write and publish stories in one single space. Most of the time people have to use multiple websites or pay for stories ,download them and then share them. But not anymore because this is where WriteMe comes in. We want to make a writing app tailored for writers and readers at heart that uses the modern abundance of NLP tools to give writers suggestions as to how to better improve their work. Suggestions ranging from common error corrections to story progression, character development and sentence construction. We also want to take advantage of the technilogical advances in todays society mainly the use of AI to help make our users experience even easier and better.

### Run Through:

**Costa** WriteMe is a safe and secure application that has multiple different log in and sign up methods to make life as easy as possible for the user. Khyal can use his Github account to sign up with just a few clicks.Once signed up he has a wide variety of published stories he can view but he first wants to create his own story before reading other ones. Creating a story is as simple as selecting the create story button and entering a title for your story. There are other fields that he may enter at this time but these are optional. He must however enter a title as this field is required and he will not be able to continue without doing this. Once creating his story he will be able to use our editor to write his story.

**Luca** To help Khyal with styling so he can fully focus on the creative side of the story our editor has many helpful commands. These commands consists of various shortcuts for styling such as different sized headings, lists and media. Khyal can also choose from a wide variety of suggestions on the right hand side if he gets stuck or needs some inspiration. Once Kiyal is finished with his story he can publish his story for all other WriteMe users to see and enjoy. Once published Khyals story is added to the list of stories we saw earlier.

**Yash** Once he has read through his story he would also like to see the rest of the communities work so he heads over to the explore page to see what other people have been working on. From the explore page he can read any of the published stories. Khyal may prefer to read stories in dark mode so he can toggle between dark and light mode to see which he prefers. Finally once Khyal is done he can log out and will return to the landing page.
