Khyal hasnt created a new story for a while so to make the process quick and easy he uses WriteMe's onboarding system. The onboarding system will take him through a step-by-step procedure on how to firstly create a story and secondly create a new chapter for his story. This step-by-step guide includes helpful information as well as pointers on what to click next to help khyal get started.

As you can see WriteMe breaks a story into its seperate chapters. This gives Khyal complete control of writing, creating and removing specific chapters without having to search through his entire book to find a chapter. Khyal may also leave comments on each chapter as helpful notes to himself or for the community of WriteMe users to view later once the story is published. Now that khyal is happy with the structure of his chapters he can use WriteMe's powerful AI assisted Editor to write his story

To help Khyal with styling our editor has many helpful commands. These commands consists of various shortcuts for styling such as different sized headings, lists and many more. Khyal may want to add something else to his story so that it isnt just paragraph after paragraph, he has a choice between adding a video, audio or a photo. He decides that he has the perfect photo to add to this chapter and uploads it. Before adding to his story Khyal likes to brainstorm some ideas and can use the prompt pad on the right to take notes and float around some ideas. He may want to use some of these ideas at a later stage so he can save the notes in the prompt pad to local storage and may recover these notes at a later time. Another helpful feature of WriteMe to get Khyals creative juices flowing is the improv suggestions. Khyal may start the improv suggestions and answer the questions that follow to help him get ideas for his story. Khyals answers to the improv suggestion questions will be displayed on the right hand side for when he needs some inspiration.

Once Khyal is ready to continue writing his story he will also have help from WriteMe's wide variety of AI features. After highlighting a sentence Khyal can see all the different AI assistance that WriteMe offers along with explanations of what each option does when hovering over them. He firstly would like to see the analysis of a certain paragraph. On the right hand side the different parts of speech are identified by hovering over each word in the sentence along with tone, entity and charachter detection. Next Khyal isnt sure if his last sentence is Grammaticaly correct so he decides to run it through the AI Grammar checker to see if there is anything wrong and to get possible suggestions on how to fix grammatical errors. Khyal isnt sure about how the first sentence sounds so he runs it through the AI Paraphrasing feature to see suggestions on other ways to write it without changing the meaning. After all of this Khyal is running low on ideas so he decides to use the AI Sentence Suggestion feature to get suggestions for his next paragraph.

Khyal is struggling with what to write next so he takes a little break and decides to read some stories published by other WriteMe users. From the explore page kyhal can see a wide variety of published stories. Khyal can also perform a semantic search on a stories title or genre. Khyal can also filter the published stories by genre or the dates they were created at either from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.Khyal likes adventure books so he filters by the adventure Genre tag and likes the sound of The Star Weaver so decides to give it a read. He enjoys the first few paragraphs so he likes the story and leaves a comment on it. Khyal would like to finish reading this story later so he bookmarks it which adds to it to his bookmark tab in his profile.

Khyal now feels like a bit of a challenge so he decides to join one of WriteMe's Writeathons. On the Writeathons page Khyal can see all active and upcoming Writeathons. After selecting the Writeathon he would like to participate in, he can either write out a new story to submit or add an existing story of his own. He has the perfect story for this Writeathon so he uploads that as his entry. After entering his story, Khyal may vote on other stories that have also been entered by other people for certain awards. After the completion of a Writeathon, award badges are handed out to users with the most votes for each category. Khyal wants to set up his own Writeathon for tomorrow so he simply presses the create button and chooses a description, and the start and end dates. Khyal would like to see if he won any badges from a Writeathon he entered yesterday so he heads over to his profile page to look at his badges. Here he can see that he recently won a Pacing Pro badge for having the best paced story in the previous Writeathon. In the profile page Khyal can see all of the Writeathon badges he has won along with all stories he has written and bookmarked.

Khyal would now like to carry on with his own story but feels like he needs some help from a friend. Khyal heads over to the chapter he wants to edit and creates a Real-Time Collaboration session so that him and his friend can work on his story together. Khyal has the choice between a read only session and a read and write session but wants his friend to be able to make changes as well so he creates a read and write session. After creating the session Khyal can simply send his friend the link and his friend can join the session. Khyal and his friend may now edit this chapter and see their changes in Real-Time along with a cursor to show where each person is working. Khyal and his friend have hit a bit of a roadblock so they use the whiteboard feature which also updates in Real-Time to throw around some ideas and have a little brainstorming session. Once Khyals friend is done Khyal simply ends the collaboration session. After re-reading what they have done Khyal isnt to happy with it and would like to go back to what he had before his friend joined so he can use WriteMe's versioning system to go back to his previously saved version.

Khyal is done for the day but needs something to read on the train home where he wont have internet connection. Khyals friend told him that The Midnight Library is a very good story so Khyal heads over to the explore page and searches for the story. He then exports it to a PDF so that he can read it offline while he is on the train.
