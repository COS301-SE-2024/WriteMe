Khyal is currently busy with one of his stories and would like to pick up where he left off. From the edit story page Khyal adds genre tags to his story to let others know what genres his story falls under. Khyal also decides before continuing to write his story that he wants to update the cover image of his story so he uploads an image of his choice. This may also be done for individual chapters if he would like to. Khyal is now ready to continue writing his story so he heads over to the editor.

Khyal wants to add something else to his story so that it isnt just paragraph after paragraph, he has a choice between adding a video, audio or a photo. He decides that he has the perfect photo to add to this chapter and uploads it. Before adding to his story Khyal likes to brainstorm some ideas and can use the prompt pad on the right to take notes and float around some ideas. He may want to use some of these ideas at a later stage so he can save the notes in the prompt pad to local storage and may recover these notes at a later time. Another helpful feature of WriteMe to get Khyals creative juices flowing is the improv game. Khyal may start the improv game and answer the questions that follow to help him get ideas for his story. Khyals answers to the improv game questions will be displayed on the right hand side for when he needs some inspiration.

Once Khyal is ready to continue writing his story he will also have help from WriteMe's wide variety of AI features. After highlighting a sentence Khyal can see all the different AI assistance that WriteMe offers along with explanations of what each option does when hovering over them. He firstly would like to see the analysis of a certain paragraph. On the right hand side the different parts of speech are identified by hovering over each word in the sentence along with tone, entity and charachter detection. Next Khyal isnt sure if his last sentence is Grammaticaly correct so he decides to run it through the AI Grammar checker to see if there is anything wrong and to get possible suggestions on how to fix grammatical errors. Khyal isnt sure about how the first sentence sounds so he runs it through the AI Paraphrasing feature to see suggestions on other ways to write it without changing the meaning. After all of this Khyal is running low on ideas so he decides to use the AI Sentence Suggestion feature to get suggestions for his next paragraph. Khyal isnt very happy with what he has added to his story today so he decides to use WriteMe's versioning feature to see a list of the previous versions of his story and revert back to the one he wants to carry on from.

After a long day of writing his own stories Khyal enjoys reading other WriteMe users stories so he heads over to the explore page. Khyal remembers a friend of his mentioning an interesting story he read the other day about Karma but cant remember the exact title so he searches for all stories with the word Karma in them. After finding the story he wants he decides that he is to tired to read it today but would like to read it at a later stage so he bookmarks the story which adds it under his bookmarks in his profile page making it quick and easy to find when he is ready to read it.
