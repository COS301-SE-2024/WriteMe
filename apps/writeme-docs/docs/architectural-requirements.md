# Architectural Requirements

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## 1 Introduction

This document serves as a blueprint of our team's approach in defining the architectural framework for WriteMe, an innovative collaborative writing platform. It outlines our stategic methodology, the architectural patterns employed, the quality requirements influencing our decisions, the constriants encountered, and the chosen technologies that power our system.

## 2 Architectural Design Strategy

Our architectural design strategy focuses on creating a collaborative writing platform that is robust and user-friendly. We start by breaking down our system into clear functional and quality requirements made by the team and prioritised by the clients, using practical use cases to guide our development process. This helps us build modular subsystems and components that are flexible and easy to maintain. By carefully selecting architectural patterns that enhance storytelling and user engagement, we ensure our platform integrates seamlessly with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. This approach guarantees that WriteMe provides a cohesive and enjoyable writing experience, inspiring creativity and enabling writers to thrive.

Apart from reliability, performance, usability,compatibility and security the architecture should also be based around:

1. User-Centric Design:
Designing based on quality requirements puts the users' needs and expectations at the forefront. Since WriteMe is used by Readers and Writers and aims to build communities, the needs of our users' are paramount.
2. Facilitates Long-term Maintenance and Rapid Development:
A system designed based on quality requirements is generally more maintainable in the long run. When a system is created with a focus on aspects such as modularity, performance, reliability, and security, it is typically easier to identify and fix issues, add new features, and scale as needed all in a timely manner.

This is our main architectural strategy, other strategies like decomposition and generating test cases are still important and will be applied in the different phases of the project.

## 3 Architectural Styles

1. Multi-tier Architechture
2. Model View Controller Architecture
3. Client-Server Architecture
4. REST Architecture
5. Peer-to-peer

### 3.1 Multi-tier Architecture

Our software architecture doesn't adhere to a strict layered model due to the bidirectional communication pathways between its components. Instead, it's organized into distinct tiers, each housing a specific set of functionalities.

The web application's user interface (UI), API calls, cloud functions for data processing, and database interactions are all physically separated, residing on their own independent tiers. Each tier acts as a cluster of modules, collectively providing a cohesive set of services.

In our mapping system, we've defined three primary tiers:

- Presentation Tier: This encompasses the user interface and application client interfaces, responsible for visual rendering and user interaction.

- Logic Tier: This serves as the central hub, managing interactions between various components such as the persistent database storage, client, cloud functions, API gateway. It handles the core application logic and data manipulation.

- Data Access Tier: This tier is dedicated to data storage and retrieval, encompassing the database and media storage.

This tiered structure, while allowing bidirectional communication, maintains a clear separation of concerns, promoting modularity, flexibility, and easier maintenance of the system

### 3.2 Model View Controller Architecture

Our web application's client-side interaction is structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, albeit with a modern twist. We leverage Next.js as our front-end framework, which implements a refined version of MVC known as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).

Next.js's MVVM architecture facilitates seamless two-way data binding between the View and the ViewModel. This dynamic relationship enables our web application to automatically propagate changes within the user interface. Whenever a change event occurs, the UI is updated to reflect the modified state within the front-end data bindings. This capability is particularly advantageous for our colabertative system, where real-time updates are essential. While MVVM permeates our entire application, its primary role lies within the presentation layer. Here, it ensures that the UI remains responsive and accurately mirrors the underlying state changes, enhancing the user experience.

In our Next.js implementation:

- View: Server Component files define the visual layout and appearance of the user interface.

- Model: Files in the db and services folder which encapsulate the logic and data management. This defines a contract for interacting with back-end services.

- Controller (ViewModel): Client Component files act as the bridge between the View and Model. They handle user input, manage data binding, and orchestrate UI updates based on changes in the Model.

### 3.3 Client-Server Architecture

In our system, the display of information to the client is facilitated through a dedicated interface, API, that communicates with the database.

This database houses all the important information and data about the users, stories, chapters as well as interactions from the users.

User interaction with the UI components triggers calls to the server. For instance, opening a story triggers the backend to retrieve said story and display it accordingly.

### 3.4 REST Architecture

Our system utilizes a REST API for synchronous communication. This API responds to requests made to resource URIs with JSON-formatted payloads, specifically handling PUT, GET, and POST methods.

Within our system, the REST API governs operations on the media storage, managing the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of users, stories, chapters and interactions between them.

The REST architectural style contributes significantly to the scalability of our system and enables the establishment of a tiered architecture. Additionally, it enhances security by requiring a `Bearer: <Token>` header for accessing protected routes with sensitive data, effectively preventing unauthorized access.

Furthermore, the REST API plays a crucial role in implementing the user registration mechanism. It facilitates communication with cloud functions, streamlining the registration process and ensures data integrity.

### 3.5 Peer-to-Peer

Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture offers a decentralized approach to real-time collaborative editing. Unlike traditional client-server models, where a central server manages document changes, a P2P system allows each userâ€™s device to directly communicate with others in the session. This architecture reduces server dependency and enhances privacy, as no central entity holds all the data. Technologies like WebRTC and Yjs enable real-time synchronization of document state across peers by efficiently broadcasting updates to all participants. P2P also scales well in small to medium-sized groups, allowing seamless collaboration with minimal latency. However, implementing conflict resolution strategies, such as Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), is critical to ensure consistency across the distributed document, even when peers are temporarily offline or working in parallel.

## 5 Architectural Constraints

### Deployment

Application is required to be deployed to AWS.

### Security

Specific encryption standards are necessary to protect sensitive data from breaches and ensure that the app meets industry standards for data security. Thus, the use of standardized authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth) ensures secure user authentication and authorization, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

### Cost

The system requires the use of AWS, therefore implementing budget constraints within AWS will ensure that the overall cost of infrastructure and services does not exceed the allocated budget.

### Reliability

By leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure and services, the app can achieve high reliability, ensuring consistent availability and performance even in the face of potential failures and disruptions. Amazon S3 will be used to automatically back up user data and application data, ensuring that critical information is protected and can be recovered in caseÂ ofÂ dataÂ loss.
