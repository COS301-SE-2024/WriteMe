# Pair Programming

:::info
Pair Programming is when developers work together on a single machine, working on the same issue at the same time.
It can be done remotely in vs code with the help of the live share extension.
:::

## Recommended extension

Microsoft live share

## Commit Message Co-Auth line

- If the live share does not automatically add the Co-Auth tag or the developers are working in-person on the same issue.

:::tip
The tag can be added manually at the end of the commit message. (Leave an **empty line** between the commit message and the co-auth tag)
:::

```shell
Co-authored-by: GitHubUserName <GithubEmail>

# eg. Co-authored-by: u22738917 <u22738917@tuks.co.za>
```
